# GLSL Web CRT Shader

Tweakable CRT shader for the web/canvas/three.js/etc

If you use this in your game/app/website I'd love to know.

## Try it

[LIVE DEMO](https://gingerbeardman.github.io/glsl-web-crt-shader/)

😎

## Notes

- in this example the source image is scaled with interpolation (smoothing) to add to the vibe
- you want to try to match the number of lines to the output resolution (here, 256)
- optimised to run well on as far back as iPhone XS (2018, A12 Bionic CPU w/ 4-core GPU)
